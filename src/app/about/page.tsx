                <p className="text-justify">
                  As a computer science graduate passionate about building and
                  experimenting with technology, I like joining hackathons,
                  which push my creativity and problem-solving skills
                  <span style={{ textDecoration: "line-through" }}>
                    {" "}
                    (totally not because of the free swags and food)
                  </span>
                  . My strong interest in web3 and cutting-edge technologies
                  heavily influences my projects. Always eager to join
                  hackathons or competitions, I'm keen to collaborateâ€”so feel
                  free to reach out if you're looking for a teammate!
