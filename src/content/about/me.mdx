# About Me

Hi, I'm Karim. A frontend developer who thrives in collaborative and creative environments. Dedicated to building user-friendly tools, fostering a community of aspiring developers, and cultivating a vibrant ecosystem

Before diving into the world of frontend development, my interest was in design, with a particular fondness for the neubrutalism style. I loved researching, exploring concepts, and hypothesizing their impacts. This passion naturally led me to the exciting realm of frontend development.

My interest in frontend development is reflected in my work, as I create a new frontend project every week. You can check out my projects on my Instagram
